This Repository simply holds the docker configuration and scripts for setting up the docker environment that underpins the entire backend/middleware of the app.

The docker setup makes it possible for developers to have a different docker environment for their project.

# To Begin:

`APP_ENV=dev`
`APP_USER=name` the name should corresponde with the .env file name under /env-conf
